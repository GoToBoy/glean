## What This Fork Includes

- RSS/Atom subscriptions with nested folders, OPML import/export, and per-feed refresh state.
- RSSHub support with admin-configured conversion, auto-fallback, and manual RSSHub-path subscription.
- Discover workflow for finding new sources and converting candidates into subscriptions.
- Immersive bilingual reading with persisted translation cache and multiple translation providers.
- **Today Board** for grouped per-feed daily ingestion views with one-click "Mark All Read" and smart collapsible sections.
- **Advanced Article Acquisition**: Layered pipeline using Playwright-enabled browser fallback for RSS sources that are summary-only or protected by anti-bot challenges (e.g., OpenAI News).
- Bookmarks, tags, read-later, folder organization, and responsive desktop/mobile reader flows.
- **Interactive Reading**: Support for keyboard navigation (j/k), inline original article view with iframe fallback, and cross-device list anchor persistence.
- Optimized reader experience with zero-jitter read status synchronization and automatic scroll reset on article switch.
- Admin dashboard with feed operations, retry/reset actions, batch management, and user administration.
- PostgreSQL + `pgvector` vector storage. This fork no longer depends on Milvus.

## Why This Fork Uses Its Own Primary Branch

This fork is intentionally moving faster than upstream and is not waiting on upstream merge cadence.
The intended primary branch is `personal-main`, which serves as this repo's release line.

### Core Additions Compared with Upstream `main`

- **Vector Stack Migration**: Transitioned from Milvus to `pgvector` (PostgreSQL), simplifying the architecture and reducing operational overhead.
- **Advanced Translation System**: End-to-end translation pipeline with multiple providers (including MTranServer), sentence-level bilingual rendering, and persistent caching.
- **Discover + RSSHub Flow**: Integrated discovery service for finding new sources with automatic RSSHub fallback and conversion rules.
- **Behavioral Signals & Ranking**: Implicit feedback event tracking to provide a data foundation for future personalized ranking and recommendation features.
- **Today Board**: Grouped per-feed daily ingestion view with one-click "Mark All Read" and smart collapsible sections.

### Systemic Optimizations

- **Reader & List UX**: Refactored desktop/mobile shells, improved list virtualization with reliable anchor restoration, and eliminated UI jitter during read status synchronization.
- **Feed Ingestion Robustness**: Enhanced failure handling (e.g., 429 rate limiting), improved idempotency, and added detailed fetch-attempt observability.
- **Admin & Ops**: Batch operations in the admin dashboard, static asset precompression, Cloudflare Tunnel integration, and optimized Docker deployment configurations.
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded multi-layer tests across API, workers, and frontend hooks to ensure long-term stability.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Download the compose file from this branch
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoToBoy/glean/personal-main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml

# Optional: download the example env file from this branch
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoToBoy/glean/personal-main/.env.example -o .env

# Optional: point Dockerized backend/worker at an external MTranServer
# Example: MTRAN_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.31.19:8989

# Start Glean
docker compose up -d
```

Access:

- Web App: `http://localhost`
- Admin Dashboard: `http://localhost:3001`
- API Health: `http://localhost:8000/api/health`

### Default Admin Account

An admin account is created automatically by default:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Admin123!`

Change this password before any real deployment.

## Deployment Notes

This fork uses a single PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension for vector storage.
There is no separate Milvus service in the default stack.

Default services:

- `postgres` - PostgreSQL 16 with `pgvector`
- `redis` - task queue / cache
- `backend` - FastAPI API server
- `worker` - background jobs for feed fetch, browser-based full-text extraction, cleanup, translation, embeddings
- `web` - main reader UI
- `admin` - admin dashboard

Prebuilt images are available on GHCR:

- `ghcr.io/leslieleung/glean-backend:latest`
- `ghcr.io/leslieleung/glean-web:latest`
- `ghcr.io/leslieleung/glean-admin:latest`

Supported architectures: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`

## Configuration

Important environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key | `change-me-in-production-use-a-long-random-string` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password | `glean` |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Default admin username | `admin` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Default admin password | `Admin123!` |
| `CREATE_ADMIN` | Auto-create admin at startup | `true` |
| `WEB_PORT` | Web UI port | `80` |
| `ADMIN_PORT` | Admin UI port | `3001` |
| `IMAGE_TAG` | Docker image tag | `latest` |
| `MTRAN_SERVER_URL` | External translation endpoint reachable from backend/worker containers | unset |
| `WORKER_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Worker timeout for long-running jobs | `1800` |
| `WORKER_MAX_JOBS` | Max concurrent arq jobs in the worker | `4` |
| `FEED_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | Scheduled feed refresh interval and default `next_fetch_at` delay | `720` |
| `WORKER_MEMORY_LIMIT` | Docker memory hard limit for the worker container | `2g` |
| `WORKER_MEMORY_RESERVATION` | Docker memory reservation for the worker container | `1g` |
| `BROWSER_EXTRACTION_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | Max concurrent Playwright extractions | `1` |
| `BROWSER_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Per-page Playwright extraction timeout | `20` |

For all options, see [.env.example](./.env.example).

Performance note for Docker deployments:

- The default stack now keeps `glean-worker` intentionally conservative: `WORKER_MAX_JOBS=4`, `BROWSER_EXTRACTION_MAX_CONCURRENCY=1`, and a `2g` worker memory cap.
- Scheduled feed refresh now defaults to every 12 hours via `FEED_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES=720`; you can override it in your Compose environment when you want a different interval.
- If you increase feed backfill throughput or add new worker tasks later, treat memory and concurrency as part of the feature design rather than an afterthought.

## Current Capability Highlights

### Reader and Translation

- Auto-translate non-Chinese content into Chinese.
- Sentence/paragraph-aware bilingual rendering with persisted cache.
- Configurable translation providers, including external MTranServer deployments and remote-provider setups.
- Improved mobile reader navigation, list restore, and reduced duplicate translation work.

### Feeds and Discovery

- Add feeds by feed URL, website URL, or RSSHub path.
- RSSHub auto-fallback when a source URL is not directly subscribable.
- Discover page with candidate feedback and source exploration.
- Feed refresh tracking with attempt/success timestamps and clearer error handling.

### Admin and Operations

- Feed-level refresh controls plus refresh-all / retry-errored actions.
- Batch operations in the admin feed list.
- User management, password reset, and subscription import workflows.
- Docker-oriented deployment with branch-specific compose files and support for external translation services.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Python 3.11+ / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy 2.0
- PostgreSQL + `pgvector`
- Redis + arq worker queue

### Frontend

- React 18 / TypeScript / Vite
- Tailwind CSS / Zustand / TanStack Query

## Development

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full setup.
For the runtime-mode split and Docker guidance, see [docs/operations/local-runtime-modes.md](./docs/operations/local-runtime-modes.md).

Recommended local modes:

- Mode A: daily development. Docker runs only `postgres` and `redis`; the host runs `api`, `worker`, `web`, and `admin`.
- Mode B: clean local verification. Docker runs the full stack from local builds.
- Mode C: deployment-like compose run. Docker runs the packaged images from `docker-compose.yml`.

Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoToBoy/glean.git
cd glean
npm install

# Install backend and frontend dependencies
make install-backend
make install-frontend

# Start infra only
make up

# Create database schema
make db-upgrade

# Create or reset the local admin account
cd backend && uv run python scripts/create-admin.py --username admin --password 'Admin123!' --role super_admin --force

# Start all dev services
make dev-all

# Or run services individually in separate terminals
make api
make worker
make web
make admin
```

Initialization notes:

- `make up` starts only `postgres` and `redis`
- the project is not fully initialized until migrations have run
- `admin / Admin123!` is only expected to work after the admin creation script completes

Clean full-stack Docker verification:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d --build
```

Development endpoints:

- Web: `http://localhost:3000`
- Admin: `http://localhost:3001`
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`
